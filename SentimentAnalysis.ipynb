If so remember those have limits and if you are just starting to invest,  broad indexes like the ones above probaly wont get you there in 25 years. Its not impossible, but I think a better game plan would be to directly buy individual tech stocks you like; But take my advice and dont just do tech, tech has a habit of slowing down as it is right now.\n",
